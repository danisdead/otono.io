<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 32px;">_ Simplexity</p><br/<br/>

<p>By Rolando Hern&aacute;ndez & Enrique Maraver</p><br/>

<p>A collection of short episodes, Simplexity is the merging of a few brief moments lived by two sound artists in their own paths. This is a memory of the lo-fi experiments in field recording done by Enrique Maraver and the in situ live touring of Rolando Hern&aacute;ndez: the witnessing not of an especific composition, but rather of the ephemeral fleeting of a few instants in ambient noise and natural aural dins. The result are 10 audio fragments that gather seven recordings of public spaces in Mexico City, and a few that register the live situacionism of Rolando's recent performing with a piece especifically done for an intervened CD Player.</p><br/>

<p>Together, Rolando and Enrique gather these moments of 2014 in a temporary net art experiment for the Otono label, only available as a 24 hour stream. This is the culmination of a year's worth details, previously only experienced by those present, and now released as a digital eclipse that shall only exist in our online memory on tonight's winter solstice.</p><br/>

<p>This is not music, this is the invisible game of sound as it is captured in its magical space.</p>
